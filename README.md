In this repository you will find some projects done during the Udacity's data analyst nanodegree. Depending on which projects, 
you might need softwares like Jupyter, Python IDE or Rstudio to run specific files. For HTML files, you would "save as" 
the file to view it in your browser.

The following projects are:
1. Analysis of A/B testing
2. EDA in a red wines dataset
3. Exploration of US bikeshare dataset using python and getting descriptive statistics
4. Statistical analysis of the Stroop Effect
